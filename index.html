                Ben is a great developer who excels at translating business requirements and needs into code. I worked with him as a Product Owner and many of our features would not have come together as smoothly as they did without his input. He was always a go-to for me when planning. I could bring the business goal to him and he'd always have a few thoughtful choices about different ways we could achieve it. He'd work with me to arrive at the best option for the situation and I value his input highly.
            </p>
            <p>
                We worked closely together on a lot of projects and he stands out as someone whose input and involvement was always solid. Out of many developers I've worked with, Ben stands out in his ability to go beyond code (which he's great at), really understand the business need, and will work to achieve it.

                Ben is one of the most awesome developers I've had the pleasure to work with over the years! As a graphic designer I never had to worry about handing off designs for him to build and implement because his keen attention to detail and thoughtfulness meant the design would look and function as intended, time and time again. He's always up to learning and is great at communicating any technical limitations that may need to be designed around, that is in the rare cases there wasn't a workaround he was able to come up with. You really can't go wrong including Ben on your team!

                In today's world, it's really hard to find a true programmer; Someone who understands the art of logic behind the machine; Someone who can create work that not only serves a purpose in the moment, but scales in itself to go well beyond that. Ben understands problem solving like no other. He continuously acquires new skills, adding to his ever-growing arsenal of programming weaponry like nobody I've ever seen, and he develops things so well thought out and so cutting edge that it sets new standards for other developers. I consider myself a veteran, but I sometimes find it hard to keep up with Ben. He has blown me away time and again with his dedication, he impresses clients, and brings awe to other fellow developers. He's even a great dad from what I hear. I always welcome any job that includes Ben because I know it will be done right.

                Ben is an amazing learner. Sure, the guy can code and develop some amazingly elegant, efficient solutions; he can even design some wicked layouts. But Ben's greatest skill is his ability (and passion) to learn. He never has to be asked twice to figure something out. In fact, "I don't know" isn't even in his vocabulary... "I can certainly find out for you" is always his immediate response in the (rare) occasion that he doesn't readily have an answer.

                Any organization could do a lot worse than having someone like Ben Yarbrough on its team. His talent is only outmatched by his propensity for knowledge.
