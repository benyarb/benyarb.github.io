            <h3>Web Developer • BKV</h3>
            <aside>Sep 2009 – Jul 2012 • 2 yrs 11 mos</aside>

            <p>
                Lead developer of a large internal project.
                Simultaneously developed websites, mobile sites, social apps, landing pages, and HTML emails for such clients as ApartmentGuide, ARS/Rescue Rooter, AT&amp;T, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, Crohn's and Colitis Foundation, Delta TechOps, LasikPlus, March of Dimes, Sokolove Law, and South University.
                Specialized in the utilization of content management systems, code frameworks, and emerging web technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
                I regularly worked on projects ranging from 1-page landers to sites and web applications with incredible amounts of functionality.
                I implemented ExpressionEngine to grant clients full control over their content, built upon and extended ExpressionEngine's functionality by developing add-ons that were useful to multiple clients, and created entirely custom web applications using CodeIgniter and a variety of other web technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to my ExpressionEngine and CodeIgniter work, I stayed on the cutting-edge of many emerging technologies.
                Seeing the market trend toward mobile, I quickly and methodically learned the skills necessary to compete.
                I regularly created mobile sites for the major mobile platforms (iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone, and Blackberry).
                Another market trend I prepared for was the social market.
                I went from knowing nothing about programming Facebook applications to being proficient within 3 weeks.
                I created ApartmentGuide's Facebook application to perform apartment searches within Facebook - the first app of its kind in that market.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was the client-facing technical lead on many projects - managing client expectations, project planning, requirements-gathering, information architecture mapping, and more.
                In addition to my development responsibilities, I was active in the interviews and technical screens of countless potential employees.
                I administered and maintained many of the company's LAMP servers, version control systems, and CMS implementations.
